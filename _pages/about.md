### Method
Interstitial Pseudo-Muon Fusion (IPMF) relates to a method and apparatus for producing controlled nuclear-fusion reactions by drastically increasing the probabilistic interactions of atoms as opposed to relying solely on brute-force hot fusion.

Currently, the most promising fusion reactors deploy and energize Deutrium-Tritium fuel, contained at a target, to temperatures several times the sun’s core leveraging complex and massive power supplies or capacitors and lasers.  Most stars’ cores are not hot enough for temperature alone to account for all the fusion occurring within them. Solar fusion can be explained by quantum tunneling: as protons approach the coulomb barrier, they are likely to be repelled by electrostatic forces, but there is a small chance that their wave-like existence has tunneled through to the other side of the barrier. Therefore, the strong force kicks in and they fuse. Due to the large number of protons in stars, this low-probability event occurs frequently.

Our techniques enhance the quantum tunneling of nucleons, opening the gateway to self-sustained fusion reactions while significantly lowering the cost, size, and mass of fusors by circumventing the massive temperature, power supply, and plasma confinement requirements of hot fusion.

### Market
The product of our fusion reactor is energy in the form of 1- high energy neutrons and 2- heat. High energy neutrons are hard to come by and have applications in multiple industries. Heat can be converted into electrical energy. We target new customer segments, each larger in market size, as our technology evolves to facilitate higher reaction densities and yields greater magnitudes of output neutron flux and heat energy. Phase 1 will target suppliers of medical isotopes. Phase 2 will enable the treatment of hazardous radioactive waste from nuclear fission and the production of rare earth metals. Phase 3 will focus on energy generation for utility-scale baseload power as well mobile fleet applications such as submarines, ships, and space shuttles.

### Team
Lemma comprises a team of five founders from different walks of life who collectively have over a hundred years of experience across diverse but complementary domains: systems engineering; simulation and commissioning of nuclear reactors; strategic planning and program management of multi-billion dollar capital upgrades for the electrical grid; technology and management consulting; and business development for high-growth startups. Collectively, we share a passion and track record for engaging with deep technology and grappling with market forces to enable high-impact societal and environmental transformation. While we acknowledge that most prevalent approaches to fusion are worthwhile pursuits, we recognize that the phenomena underpinning fusion – quantum tunnelling – is quirky enough to warrant alternate explorations. Our proposed approach is not based on new science, but rather an innovative set of engineering tactics. Our long-standing experience in this industry and our preliminary work leave us reasonably confident that we are onto an approach that would facilitate fusion reactions while achieving a step-change reduction in the cost, complexity, and size of fusion reactor systems.
