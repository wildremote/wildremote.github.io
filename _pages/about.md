### Method
Interstitial Pseudo-Muon Fusion (IPMF) relates to a method and apparatus for producing controlled nuclear-fusion reactions by drastically increasing the probabilistic interactions of atoms as opposed to relying solely on brute-force hot fusion.

Currently, the most promising fusion reactors deploy and energize Deutrium-Tritium fuel, contained at a target, to temperatures several times the sun’s core leveraging complex and massive power supplies or capacitors and lasers.  Most stars’ cores are not hot enough for temperature alone to account for all the fusion occurring within them. Solar fusion can be explained by quantum tunneling: as protons approach the coulomb barrier, they are likely to be repelled by electrostatic forces, but there is a small chance that their wave-like existence has tunneled through to the other side of the barrier. Therefore, the strong force kicks in and they fuse. Due to the large number of protons in stars, this low-probability event occurs frequently.

Our techniques enhance the quantum tunneling of nucleons, opening the gateway to self-sustained fusion reactions while significantly lowering the cost, size, and mass of fusors by circumventing the massive temperature, power supply, and plasma confinement requirements of hot fusion.

### Market
The product of our fusion reactor is energy in the form of 1- high energy neutrons and 2- heat. High energy neutrons are hard to come by and have applications in multiple industries. Heat can be converted into electrical energy. We target new customer segments, each larger in market size, as our technology evolves to facilitate higher reaction densities and yields greater magnitudes of output neutron flux and heat energy. Phase 1 will target suppliers of medical isotopes. Phase 2 will enable the treatment of hazardous radioactive waste from nuclear fission and the production of rare earth metals. Phase 3 will focus on energy generation for utility-scale baseload power as well mobile fleet applications such as submarines, ships, and space shuttles.
